# DotChat: A .NET IRC Client

DotChat is a console-based .NET IRC client created for a C# course at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. Since it was created for an assignment, it is not a full implementation of the IRC protocol. The user is able to connect to the server of their choice but can only be in a single channel at a time. The following common user commands are supported by the application:

```
/JOIN <channel>
/PART
/MSG <user> <message>
/NICK <nickname>
/HELP
/QUIT
```
